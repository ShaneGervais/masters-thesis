    For the development of new quantum technologies, such as
    quantum computers, quantum sensors for quantum metrology, or
    quantum telecommunications, it is essential to be able to
    characterize the quantum states of quantum systems. The 
    characterization of quantum states is an active area of research,
    as it allows for understanding, measuring and manipulating quantum systems.

    \noindent Traditional characterization methods, such as quantum
    tomography, reconstructs a quantum system's state by performing projective measurements
    on the system, followed by a reconstruction of the state using the density matrix.
    However, this approach is an indirect method that requires
    many projective measurements and does not allow for real-time 
    tracking of the quantum state evolution, as it requires the 
    use of a computational algorithm. Furthermore, it is limited 
    by the increasing complexity of high-dimensional quantum systems,
    making the reconstruction of the system's state increasingly 
    difficult and resource-intensive. Thus, it is not suitable 
    for systems requiring real-time characterization, where the 
    temporal evolution of a state is crucial, such as in quantum
    metrology or for error detection in quantum computers
    during computational processes.

    \noindent An alternative method, such as weak measurements,
    is a promising approach for the direct characterization of quantum states,
    without complete collapse of the system; however, in its current form,
    it is not integrable into quantum technologies. In this thesis, we propose to perform
    temporal weak measurements by exploiting the temporal domain of photons
    as our pointer variable, by designing an experimental device in this regime
    to characterize a quantum state that can be easy to implement in a common optics laboratory.

    \noindent In this thesis, we aim to explore the different degrees of freedom
    that would allow weak measurements to be compatible with
    future quantum technologies and our existing photonic infrastructures.
    This could enable direct real-time tracking of the temporal
    evolution of a quantum state while minimizing information
    loss through the weak measurement regime.
