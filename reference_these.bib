abstract = {Surely, after 62 years, we should have an exact formulation of some serious part of quantum mechanics? By ‘exact’ I do not of course mean ‘exactly true’. I mean only that the theory should be fully formulated in mathematical terms, with nothing left to the discretion of the theoretical physicist...until workable approximations are needed in applications. By ‘serious’ I mean that some substantial fragment of physics should be covered. Nonrelativistic ‘particle’ quantum mechanics, perhaps with the inclusion of the electromagnetic field and cut-off interaction, is serious enough. For it covers ‘a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry’ (P A M Dirac 1929 Proc. R. Soc.A 123 714). I mean too, by ‘serious’, that ‘apparatus’ should not be separated off from the rest of the world into black boxes, as if it were not made of atoms and not ruled by quantum mechanics.}

Robert Beyer's 1955 English translation, which von Neumann reviewed and approved, is cited more frequently today than ever before. But its many treasures and insights were too often obscured by the limitations of the way the text and equations were set on the page. This new edition of this classic work has been completely reset in TeX, making the text and equations far easier to read. The book has also seen the correction of a handful of typographic errors, revision of some sentences for clarity and readability, provision of an index for the first time, and prefatory remarks drawn from the writings of Léon Van Hove and Freeman Dyson have been added. The result brings new life to an essential work in theoretical physics and mathematics.}",

We also show that the resulting “joint weak values” take on a particularly elegant form when expressed in terms of annihilation operators.}

quantum mechanics (QM) over the last 80 years in explaining phenomena observed at the atomic and subatomic level, the conceptual status of the theory is still a topic of lively controversy. Most of the discussion centers around two famous paradoxes (or, as some would have it, pseudoparadoxes) associated, respectively, with the names of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) and with Schrödinger's cat. In this Viewpoint, I will concentrate on the paradox of Schrödinger's cat or, as it is often known (to my mind somewhat misleadingly), the quantum measurement paradox.}}

Physicists usually learn about it indirectly in tomographic experiments that measure only some aspects of its behaviour. Now a team from Canada's Institute for National Measurement Standards has developed a new and gentle technique that makes it possible to observe the wavefunction directly. They demonstrate the approach by measuring the transverse spatial wavefunction of a single photon. The discovery that the wavefunction can be probed directly provides a tool that could prove useful in a wide range of fields, and raises questions bordering on the philosophical about what the wavefunction actually is.},

    abstract = {Photons have been a flagship system for studying quantum mechanics, advancing quantum information science, and developing quantum technologies. Quantum entanglement, teleportation, quantum key distribution, and early quantum computing demonstrations were pioneered in this technology because photons represent a naturally mobile and low-noise system with quantum-limited detection readily available. The quantum states of individual photons can be manipulated with very high precision using interferometry, an experimental staple that has been under continuous development since the 19th century. The complexity of photonic quantum computing devices and protocol realizations has raced ahead as both underlying technologies and theoretical schemes have continued to develop. Today, photonic quantum computing represents an exciting path to medium- and large-scale processing. It promises to put aside its reputation for requiring excessive resource overheads due to inefficient two-qubit gates. Instead, the ability to generate large numbers of photons—and the development of integrated platforms, improved sources and detectors, novel noise-tolerant theoretical approaches, and more—have solidified it as a leading contender for both quantum information processing and quantum networking. Our concise review provides a flyover of some key aspects of the field, with a focus on experiment. Apart from being a short and accessible introduction, its many references to in-depth articles and longer specialist reviews serve as a launching point for deeper study of the field.},
